# Reverse Causality Model and Macroeconomic Variables Analysis

This repository contains time series data and variables used for estimating a reverse causality model and studying the relationship between macroeconomic variables and asset prices in the Brazilian financial market. The key variables included are:

- **Real market return (R_t):** Represented by the Ibovespa index from BM&FBOVESPA (`real_market_return.xlsx`).
- **Inflation rate:** Represented by the IPCA index (`inflation_targeting.xlsx`).
- **Real interest rate (œÅ_t):** Represented by the Selic Rate (`selic_rate.xlsx`).

The time series data is monthly and spans from July 1999 to December 2020, covering the period following the adoption of the Inflation Targeting Regime in Brazil.

The analyses were conducted using the **EViews 7** econometric software. This repository is intended to promote transparency and facilitate the replication of the presented results.
